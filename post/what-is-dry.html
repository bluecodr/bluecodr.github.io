<h1>What is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</h1>

DRY is a fundamental software engineering concept that teaches developers not
to write the same code twice. Let's explore what is meant by "the same code".
It is easy to think that DRY is just a matter of looking for code that looks
identical and removing one of the duplicates. This was my thinking when I was
first introduced to DRY. Having gained more experience creating and maintaining
large projects, I've come to understand that code (i.e.: syntax) duplication is
a sufficient, but not necessary indication that the DRY principle has been
broken. Instead, the developer ought to be looking for duplicated intent. Let's
look at an example:

Calculate fibonacci number iteratively:
<pre>
<code>
  def iterativeFibonacci(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
      return n

    oldSum = 0
    newSum = 1
    
    for i in range(0, n - 2):
      buffer = oldSum + newSum
      oldSum = newSum
      newSum = buffer

    return newSum

  print(iterativeFibonacci(7))
</code>
</pre>

Calculate fibonacci number recursively:
<pre>
<code>
  def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
      return n
        
    return recursiveFibonacci(n - 2, 0, 1)

  def recursiveFibonacci(n, oldSum, newSum):
    if n == 0:
      return newSum
        
    buffer = oldSum + newSum
    return recursiveFibonacci(n - 1, newSum, buffer)

  print(fibonacci(7))
</code>
</pre>

Clearly, there is no code (i.e.: syntax) duplication between these two
examples, when viewed as a whole. Yet, if one were following the DRY principle
and came across both these examples in the same codebase, it would make sense
to remove one of them, because they are both accomplshing the same task.
