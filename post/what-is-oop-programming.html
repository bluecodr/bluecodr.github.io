<h1>What is Object-Oriented Programming?</h1>

March 26th, 2020

Recently, I decided to explore <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">Design
Patterns</a> as part of my eternal quest to improve my software
engineering skills. Very quickly, I began to go down a rabbit hole of
heated discussion, first of design patterns, and then of object-oriented
programming in general. As I read through Youtube video and blog post
comments, I tried to apply my understanding of OOP to discern the
veracity of the arguments on both sides, only to discover that I don't
have a solid understanding of OOP, both in theory and practice. I've
been programming for almost 10 years, primarily in Java and C++; I'm
familiar with terms such as polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation,
class, object, etc. If asked to describe these concepts, I can provide a
generic explanation, and how to implement them in Java or C++. What's
missing from my understanding, I think, is the ability to determine when
it's appropriate to use OOP. Having said this, I still don't think I've
fully grasped the extent of my ignorance, so I'll stop trying to
describe it. The purpose of the post is to keep track of the more
constructive discussions I've come across on the Internet, as well as
the development of my thinking on the subject.
